# Set-Associative_L1-Processor-Cache
## Overview:

This project implements a 2-way set associative cache in SystemVerilog, designed for efficient L1 (Level 1) cache memory management. The implementation includes a prefetch mechanism (still under testing) and an LRU eviction policy.

## Key Features:
2-Way Set Associative Cache: Organizes cache lines into 2 sets to improve access time and reduce cache misses.

## Prefetch Mechanism: 
Fetches data in advance based on anticipated access patterns, improving overall efficiency.
